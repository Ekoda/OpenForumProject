# OpenForumProject
<p>One of the most discussed and perhaps most crucial problems of our times is that of centralized power in the technology which has come to dominate large aspects of our lives. The internet at the time of writing is dominated by major companies who exert tremendous power, extending beyond the service they provide. The Open Forum Project aims to provide an alternative solution to this centralization through providing a service upon services; a forum which could be attached to any website allowing for a parallel stream of communication to the main service. A fully developed version could effectively tie the scattered communication of the internet together and provide an avenue of communication beyond centralized control</p>
